<p>Through this module, we encourage efforts to deepen our understanding of our identity and
explore nuances in what "identity" means, how we think about it, how it works in society, and
how it affects our everyday life and interactions. Furthermore, it will help you understand how
the multiple identities we carry in our everyday life impact how conveniently we get access to
resources, and how easily we benefit from resources such as Wikipedia and its sister projects.</p>

<p>Before we start the module, please answer these questions:<br>
<i>[Note to learners and trainers: These questions are deeply personal in nature. If you feel
uncomfortable revealing the answers or writing them down, answer them silently to yourself.]</i></p>
<p>What gender (or lack thereof) do you identify with?</p>
<p>What was the gender assigned to you at birth?</p>
<p>What religion, if any, do you follow?</p>
<p>What caste, if any, do you belong to?</p>
<p>How would you define your sexual orientation?</p>
<p>What is your primary language of communication?</p>
<p>Do you own a laptop or a personal computer?</p>
<h3>What is privilege?</h3>

<i>Image description: In the picture on the left, three people of dif erent height have been given a foot stool
of the same height and they are trying to pluck a fruit from the tree. This is equality. In the picture on the
right, three people of dif erent height have been given a foot stool of dif erent heights and they are trying
to pluck a fruit from the tree. This is equity.</i></p>
<p>When we roll a dice, the possibility of getting any number from 1 to 6 is one-sixth or 16.67%.
Every number has equal possibility of showing up. When we flip a coin, chances of either heads
or tails are half or 50%. Don't we often wish every event in our lives had such equal chances?
Then, in a job interview with 5 candidates, each would have 20% probability of getting selected
irrespective of what they were wearing, the accent in which they spoke English, their place of
origin, hometown, gender, etc. Yet, reality is very different. This is because we live in an
unequal society. One way that women have it hard can be noted from the fact that it is still
difficult for women to travel or venture out late at night without having to worry about sexual
violence. This also has a bearing on women's choices in the job market both from the
perspective of an employee and as an employer. For instance, according to a recent World bank
study, Indian companies still prefer to employ men over women<sup>1</sup> . In comparison, men have it
easy. In an ideal world, everybody should have the freedom to venture out of their house without
any fear for their safety. However, men have been having it easy over a period of time just
because they are men. This is a classic example of male privilege at work.</p>
<p>Sociologists define privilege as an <strong>invisible</strong> package of <strong>unearned</strong> benefits by particular groups
that accumulate over a period of time based on their location within a social hierarchy. It is
<strong>unearned</strong> because we often get it simply owing to the circumstance in which we were born. For
instance, the quality of education we will have access to in our lifetime depends on our family,
the socio-economic condition and the location where we are born. It will determine the social
standing we have and the kind of opportunities we get in life. It is <strong>invisible</strong> because we are often
unaware of its presence. Since it is something we have had since birth, we assume that it is
normal and acceptable to have it. The nature of one's privilege can range from the caste, class,
gender, sexual identity and orientation, religion, language, etc. one belongs to. These benefits are
showered by the society without the privileged people asking for them. This video entitled <i>"Race
of life"</i> illustrates this concept pretty well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBQx8FmOT_0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBQx8FmOT_0</a></p>
<p>The discussions pertaining to the idea of <i>'privilege'</i> were widely prevalent among many
sociologists. However, the term gained currency in 1988 when academic <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_McIntosh">Peggy Mcintosh</a>
published a seminal article - White privilege and male privilege - decoding white privilege and
male privilege<sup>2</sup> . She used this opportunity to introspect her own identity and the privileges
associated with it.</p>

      <td><p>Rakesh is an information technology (IT)
professional. His father runs a construction
company. Rakesh grew up in a neighbourhood in
south Delhi.</p>
<p>As a Brahmin by caste, Rakesh's father believes
that education is very important for a person's
growth and future. Rakesh went to a private school
in Delhi. He also had a computer and an internet
connection at home. Rakesh was good at computer
science, so his teachers and family encouraged him
to participate in various activities related to the
subject. During his summer holidays, Rakeshâ€™s
father would enrol him into summer schools in
India and abroad. Rakesh graduated with an
engineering degree and then got a masterâ€™s degree.</p>
<p>Rakesh spends his free time volunteering for
projects he cares about. Rakesh's family is very
proud of his achievements, and appreciates him for
all his hard work.</p></td>
<td><p>Ranjita lives in an unauthorised settlement in south
Delhi. Her father is a daily wage earner, and her
mother works as part-time domestic help at the
residence of a renowned entrepreneur. They are of
a lower caste, and do not own any land holdings.</p>
<p>Ranjita studied at a government-run school for
girls. One day, an NGO visited her school, and
introduced her to the world of computer science
programming. She felt very excited, and was
interested in learning more about it. With the
limited resources Ranjita had, she visited the
"community library and computer centre" where
she lived, and taught herself one computer
language.</p>
<p>However, after she completed high school, her
family discouraged her by saying that courses and
jobs in computer science are for boys. Ranjita also
felt that she should work and supplement the
meagre family income, although her parents did not
explicitly asked her to do so. She tried to find a job
where she could put her computer skills to use.
However, as she had no formal education beyond
high school, candidates who had higher
qualifications were chosen over her.</p>
<p>Like her mother, Ranjita now works as a domestic
help in a few homes. She works 12 to 14 hours a
day to make ends meet. She still hopes to pursue
her dream of getting an IT job, but she finds herself
too sapped of energy, time and money to update
 and sharpen her existing skills, or to study a formal
course.</p></td>

at the beginning of this module.)</li>
  <li>Make a list of identities that you think put you at an advantage, and those that you think
put you at a disadvantage.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>[Note to learners and trainers: This exercise involves questions that are deeply personal in
nature. If you are uncomfortable doing it in a peer-group, you may reflect on this exercise and
do it in private.]</i></p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong></p>
<p>Make a list of things that you think one needs in order to effectively contribute to Wikimedia
projects.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which of those mentioned in the list do you have access to?</li>
  <li>Which of those mentioned in the list do you think are accessible to <strong>everyone,
everywhere?</strong></li>
  <li>What happens when one does not have access to the resource(s) you listed? Explain using
examples.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Intersectionality</h3>
<p>In the previous section, we studied how we sometimes have access to various resources simply
because of our identities at birth. But at any point in time, we have multiple identities. When
someone asks about our identity, our answer will vary depending on the situation. When we are
about to enter a bar, we will mention our age. When we enter a religious place, we will mention
our religion. When we go for a professional meeting, we will mention our profession and
designation. When using a dating website, we will mention our gender and sexual orientation and
preferences.</p>

_at_All_Hands,_January_2018.jpg</a></p>
<p>Depending on the identity and the context, the level of a person's vulnerability or privilege also
varies. The more layers of under-privileged identity one carries, greater is the vulnerability. For
instance, a homeless person on the street is at greater risk of being subjected to street-based
crime than someone who has a home. If the homeless person is a woman, the chances of her
being subjected to sexual violence are also higher. If she is a trans woman, she may fear being
harassed by public officials as well. If she is also disabled, she is at far greater risk. Thus, with
each layer of vulnerability, a person's chance of being oppressed increases. Hence, it is
important to view a person's identity holistically. This is called <i>intersectionality</i>.</p>
<p>Let's look at another example. In case studies above, we saw how Rakesh and Ranjita both live
in south Delhi. However, there are several differences in their lives:</p>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Rakesh belongs to an affluent family of entrepreneurs, Ranjita to a family of low-wage
workers.<br>
<strong>Caste:</strong> Rakesh hails from an upper caste, Ranjita belongs to a lower caste.<br>
<strong>Gender:</strong> Rakesh is a man, and Ranjita is a woman.<br>
Despite living in same city and the same neighbourhood, Rakesh and Ranjita's access to
resources vary because of the circumstances in which they were born. For example, Rakesh has
two professional degrees; Ranjita has completed high school.</p>
<p>Now, let us imagine a story similar to Ranjita's, in which she is a Brahmin from a family of a
lower economic class. When we compare Rakesh's and Ranjit's story, both Brahmins, we will
realise that even though both have privilege of their caste, Ranjita will face the following
disadvantages:</p>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Rakesh belongs to an affluent family of entrepreneurs, Ranjita to a family of low-wage
workers.<br>
<strong>Gender:</strong> Rakesh is a man, and Ranjita is a woman.</p>
<img src="/img/Dd41fXmVMAAwuSx.jpg" />
<p>Twitter/ Nathan W Pyle <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanwpyle/status/999294987195035649?lang=en" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/nathanwpyle/status/999294987195035649?lang=en</a></p>
<p>Let us take another scenario. Let us imagine a story similar to Rakesh's where our protagonist is
a woman, Sonam. When we compare Sonam's and Ranjita's stories, both women, even while
being subjected to similar gender-based prejudices, they will have the following differences:</p>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Sonam belongs to an affluent family of entrepreneurs, Ranjita to a family of low-wage
workers.<br>
<strong>Caste:</strong> Sonam is an upper caste woman, and Ranjita is of a lower caste.</p>
<p>These differences, which are totally outside the control and sphere of influence of Rakesh,
Sonam and Ranjita, will determine which one of them gets access to resources and the quantity
of resources at their disposal. This will also determine how they experience life in general.
Hence, no two people will ever have the same life experience. For instance, you may believe that
every child should have equal access to education. But Sonam may go to a private school with
several amenities that make the learning experience rewarding and enjoyable for her. Ranjita to
an under-resourced local municipal school. And we all know that the quality of education differs
in both these circumstances, which in turn, has an impact on the future prospects of the children
who read there.</p>

<p>Likewise, when we talk about privilege, we cannot discuss privilege of only one identity at a
time. This is because we live our multiple identities simultaneously. For instance, when we talk
about rights of queer people, we cannot ignore the fact that a Dalit queer person will face more
challenges compared that a Brahmin queer person. This issue was especially highlighted in
Pune's Pride March of 2017 where the organisers came up with the rule <i>"No slogans on religion,
caste, political parties, politicians, leaders, Supreme Court will be allowed"<sup>3</sup>.</i> This is a classic 
example of how we choose to exclude the experiences of people because of the intersection of
various identities they carry without choice. When one aspect of identity becomes the focus
while others are excluded, full inclusion will not be achieved. In our third scenario above, if we
have to advocate for Ranjita's rights, we need to bear in mind all her identities that holistically
define her. She belongs to a lower caste, a woman, and from a low income family, and that she is
at the intersection of all three identities, and more.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we watched the video entitled <i>"Race of Life"</i>. This video clearly
describes the meaning and implication of intersectionality. In the next section we will discuss
how identity, privilege and intersectionality are relevant in the context of the open knowledge
movement.</p>
