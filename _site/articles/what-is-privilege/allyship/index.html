<p>We are a part of a society that is built on multiple inequalities, which severely dis-privileges one
group of people at the cost of others. Can a privileged person give up or surrender their
privilege? No! It is socially conferred, whether or not we wish for it. It is not something that can
be detached from oneâ€™s identity. However, a privileged person can always try to be a <i>good ally</i>.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid #000000;">
  <p style="font-size:1.5rem;padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px"><strong>Empathy</strong></p>
  <p style="padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px">"Let me hold the door for you.<br>
I may have never walked in your shoes,<br>
but I can see your soles are worn,<br>
your strength is torn under the weight of a story I have never lived before.<br>
Let me hold the door for you.<br>
After all you've walked through,<br>
It's the least I can do."</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px"><i>Morgan Harper Nichols</i></p>
</div><br>
<p>What does this mean? A good ally does much more than just believe in equality. As an ally, you
acknowledge your position of privilege and oppression, and you want to change this pattern. You
are willing to listen to people when they point out your biases, and you commit to making efforts
to not repeat the same behaviour. You also promise to give the platform to those who do not
have the privileges you have, and give them a chance to voice their own life stories and
experiences.</p>
<p>Why do we need allies? We need allies because we want to ensure social justice for all. In other
words, as allies we need to fight for equal rights for all, and for fair distribution of resources.
Martin Luther King Jr. explains why we should fight for equal rights, "Injustice anywhere is a
threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a
single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly." Popular Black
writer-academic Roxane Gay says in her book 'Bad Feminist': "If we turn away and ignore
injustice, it will indirectly foster inequality in the world. All too often, when we see injustices,
both great and small, we think, That's terrible, but we do nothing. We say nothing. We let other
people fight their own battles. We remain silent because silence is easier.' Qui tacet consentire
videtur' is Latin for 'Silence gives consent.' When we say nothing, when we do nothing, we are
consenting to these trespasses against us."</p>
<p>In order to be a good ally and to facilitate changing the status quo, the first step involves learning
about and understanding our own privileges. It is only then that one can work towards an
equitable society. We have to identify and acknowledge our privilege. This is not easy because it
is usually invisible to the person at the receiving end of advantages of privilege. Where we have
privilege, we tend to assume it is acceptable and normal. Hence, when someone without that
same privilege calls attention to our unearned advantage, we may get defensive, and may fail to
acknowledge our own privilege.</p>
<p>One way to learn how to identify and acknowledge privilege is by listening empathetically to the
stories of people who do not share our privileges. It is also important to do so without judging
people or their circumstances. Empathy is defined as the ability <i>"to perceive the internal frame of
reference of another with accuracy, and with the emotional components and meanings which
pertain thereto as if one were the other person, but without ever losing the 'as if' condition"<sup>4</sup></i>.
Now, while listening to people's struggle in maneuvering the system without privilege, because
you have not faced with similar struggle, you may notice that some part of you becomes 
dismissive of their experience. Instead, actively seek to accept that different people's experience
will vary depending on various identity we carry, and each and every story is valid.</p>
