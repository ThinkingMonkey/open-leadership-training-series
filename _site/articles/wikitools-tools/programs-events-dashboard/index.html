<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Programs and Events Dashboard (P & E Dashboard) is a tool that assists
with the management of metrics information about outreach activities
related to Wikimedia projects. There are three types of intended users of this
tool: organisers, participants and observers.</p>
<p>The dashboard supports two types of events - campaigns and programs.
Programs are generally referred to as a single event, whereas a campaign is a
group of events or programs. For example, "Feminism Edit-a-thon 2018 In
London" is a program, whereas Art+Feminism altogether is a campaign.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Programs_%26_Events_Dashboard" target="_blank">documentation</a> gives a basic introduction to the dashboard. The
main purpose of the tool is to obtain metrics of various programs and events.
Organizers may create an event under the "My dashboard" tab where the
program name, institution, Wikimedia project, description, duration and
privacy level of the program can be defined. After creating the event, a link
will be generated which can be shared among the participants for them to
join the program.</p>
<p>The dashboard also allows you to "Delete program", "Schedule data update"
for historical events, "Enabling account requests" and "Download stats". To
track editing activity on multiple Wikimedia wikis, assign articles from those
wikis to one or more of the participants, and the contributions from those
projects will also be tracked.</p>
<p>The dashboard offers two kinds of tracking facilities. The first one is the
collective metrics shown on the home page of the event.</p>

<p><i><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eLDVKZK9j2urP8tqVI57KEnVi8nvXaKV/view" target="_blank">
Screenshot of the collective metrics</a></i></p>
<p>The second one is a detailed analysis in the other four sections of the event
page, namely "Editors", "Articles", "Uploads" and "Activity". Each metric can be
used in different areas of the management of an event, as explained in the
sections below.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up and managing an event</strong></p>
<p>The "Editors" tab is the core of managing the data or metrics that are being
generated by the dashboard. The metrics for all the other are populated
based on the data present here. It contains usernames of the participating
users.</p>
<p>To manage the list of participating editors, editors can either join by using the
event URL, or any of the facilitator(s) can add them to the dashboard.</p>
<img src="/img/5.jpg" />
<p><i><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hbLOOTSgXEY1tvbdI3Ezqu2mUga1_vK9/view" target="_blank">Screenshot : Management of Editors</a></i></p>

<p>Participants who do not have an account on Wikimedia projects can request
one through the dashboard. The facilitators can enable this option using
"Enable account requests" option on the home tab. You can access the list of
all requested accounts from "Participation". Upon creation, a random
password with the desired username will be emailed to the respective
participants.<sup>1</sup>

<p>During an online edit-a-thon or a photography contest, if a user wishes not to
participate or in any other case, the enrolled editors can be removed by any
facilitator. If it is needed for the participants to create accounts, you can
enable the feature from the tab.</p>
<p>If the event is focused on developing specific articles, then an article can be
assigned to each editor whose improvement can later be tracked in the
articles tab.</p>

<p>The dashboard also allows you to track historical events, by setting up the
required timings and scheduling a data update from the home page. This
can be done using the "Schedule data update" option on the home tab.</p>
<p>To create a new campaign, go to
<a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/campaigns" target="_blank">https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/campaigns</a>. For any reason, if you
wish to delete the program, you may do so after removing all the editors and
facilitators, by using the "Delete program" option on the Home tab.</p>

<h3>Analysing an event</h3>
<p>After the inputs of participants and parameters are given, the rest of the
metrics are generated by the dashboard. After an event, the metrics can be
used to analyse the success and impact achieved from various aspects.</p>
<p>Generally, the success of an event can be assessed by comparing the
homepage metrics with the proposed metrics before the event. The metrics
of the number of editors participating and the number of articles
created/improved or files uploaded, are the basic metrics that will help you to
understand whether you were able to achieve the set targets in comparison
with the expenditure on the event. The relation between the editors and
articles/ uploads can be assessed through pure common sense.</p>
<p>After a program, one of the observations that many of the organisers find
useful is if the users are contributing to Wikimedia projects post-event. This
can be analysed by the "recent edits" column from the "Editors" tab. The
recent activity shows the edits made by a user in the immediate past seven
days, irrespective of the event duration. A more detailed version of the same
metrics can be seen from the activity tab, which shows the articles edited by
the participants recently. This again shows the class, article title, editor,
characters added, timestamp, cumulative difference between revisions.</p>
<p>The total uploads are the number of images uploaded by a user to Wikimedia
Commons. The metrics for recent activity, characters added and total uploads
are sortable from highest to least and vice versa, which can help to added the
top performers for a contest. Whereas, the characters added and the total
days are for the event duration.</p>
<p> Coming to the articles tab, the page is divided to three sections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To see the list of articles of the articles created/edited by the
participants during the period of an event can be viewed from the first
section of the page.
	<ul type="circle">
	   <li>For each article listed, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XLUXvYa2rge7HA3TfieSML3T7F_2-q5p/view" target="_blank">you can analyze</a> the status of changes
made to the article in terms of structural completeness<sup>2</sup> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKF8lAeJGp8uo9n7F_oguisX9sQYu3Qy/view" target="_blank">the
size of edits of made</a> (which includes both additions and
deletions).
<img src="/img/2.jpg"/>
<p><i><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XLUXvYa2rge7HA3TfieSML3T7F_2-q5p/view" target="_blank">Screenshot</a></i></p>
<img src="/img/3.jpg">
<p><i><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKF8lAeJGp8uo9n7F_oguisX9sQYu3Qy/view">Screenshot</a></i></p></li>
    <li>If you wish to know how much of the content added to an article
was retained without any alterations (reversions/removals), you
can use the assessment tools to load the authorship data. It is one
of the best ways to understand what kind of content is value
adding to the existing Wikimedia wikis. It could also give you
information about the problematic areas, which can be used for
later analysis.</li>
    <li>You may also get the cumulative changes made to an article
during the event period.<sup>3</sup> This metric can be used to analyse what
the newly training editors bring to the existing Wikimedia
communities.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>For photographic contests or events related Wikimedia Commons, to
get the number of the media files used on Wikimedia projects, it can be
obtained from the homepage, by sliding the cursor on the number of
uploads. However, if you wish to see how many times and on which
projects is a media file used, such metrics can be obtained from the
"Uploads" tab. The list can be viewed in gallery, list and tile view.
  <ul>
    <li>This also helps to find out if an images was deleted after it was
uploaded.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to download the statistics from the event, it can be done using
"Download stats" option on the home tab. As of July 2018, it can be
downloaded in CSV format only. You can download the data as per the 
categories you require-Overview data, Edits data, Commons uploads data,
Editors data, and Articles data.</p>

<h3>Using dashboard to improve your events</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you wish to download the statistics from the event, it can be done
using the "Download stats" option on the home tab. As of July 2018, it
can be downloaded in CSV format only. You can download the data as
per the categories you require-Overview data, Edits data, Commons
uploads data, Editors data, and Articles data.
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>You can also suggest the participants to to go to this tab to get
some automated suggestions generated. One of these may
sound like "Cite your sources! This article needs more references."</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Often, participants complain that they are unable to find "What to
edit?" To deal with such a case, the last section of the "Articles" tab in
the P&G article dashboard can be used by the organisers to present a
list of articles needing improvement for the participants, and also by
the participants to find an article from their area of interest using article
finder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from event-related metrics, the dashboard also provides a range of
training resources in five various themes, as of January 2019. These are
<a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/training/learning-and-evaluation" target="_blank">Learning and evaluation</a> (using the dashboard), <a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/training/editathons" target="_blank">Edit-a-thons</a> (planning),
<a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/training/support-and-safety" target="_blank">Support & Safety</a> (safe spaces and harassment), <a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/training/editathons" target="_blank">Editing Wikipedia</a> (Basic
guidelines and wiki markup), and <a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/training/legal" target="_blank">Legal awareness</a> (handing private
information)</p>

<h3>Using dashboard to analyze an editor</h3>
<p>If you wish to find out the number of programs an editor has facilitated, it can
be done by accessing a dashboard URL in the following format:
<a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/" target="_blank">https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/users/EXAMPLEUSERNAME.</a></p>
<p>EXAMPLEUSERNAME should be replaced with the actual username without
any prefix, such as "User:" After landing on the page, you can get three
segments of data about an editor - their Contribution statistics, Course
details and Commons uploads.</p>
<img src="/img/6.jpg" />
<p><i><a href="" target="_blank">Screenshot</a> : Editor Details in Dashboard</i></p>
<p>Under "Contribution statistics", you can view a cumulative data set about an
editor, which includes;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Total number of programs facilitated.</li>
  <li>Total number of editors trained</li>
  <li>Timeline of programs (as a facilitators)</li>
  <li>Total impact made by the editors trained</li>
  <li>Total impact made as a student in the program</li>
</ul>
<p>The total impact made in available in terms of words added, article views,
articles edited/ created and Commons uploads.</p>
<p>If you would like to view of all the programs that an editor participated in any
role, a list of these can be seen under "Course details" section. The last section
contains the most recent Commons uploads by the editor.</p>
