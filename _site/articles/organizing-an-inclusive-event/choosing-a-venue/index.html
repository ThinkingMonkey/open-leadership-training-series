<h3 id="welcome-and-a-look-at-working-open-irl-in-real-life">Welcome! And a Look at Working Open IRL (In Real Life)</h3>

<p>Welcome! Weâ€™re excited that youâ€™re here. In this training series, youâ€™ll learn a specific set of practices which weâ€™re calling â€œworking open.â€�</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When you are â€œworking openâ€� you use the power, knowledge, and skills of a diverse community of volunteers (called â€œcontributorsâ€�) to accomplish something that a single person or a small team couldnâ€™t do alone.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>When your project is â€œopenâ€� you share knowledge and information generated by the project widely and freely, allow others to build on your project, and maximize its usefulness for everyone.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The Open Leadership Training Series is designed for those who want to work together with others to create, build, and make amazing stuffâ€“ anything from software projects to learning materials to organizations or advocacy campaigns. As we mentioned in the <a href="/">Series README</a>â€“ it doesnâ€™t matter if your project aims to teach kids to code in Cleveland or build mobile apps with taxi drivers in Bangladesh, this is a one-size-fits-all resource. Here is one example of how people are working open, in real life, on real projects.</p>

<h3 id="the-ingredients-of-an-open-project">The Ingredients of an Open Project</h3>

<p>Very different projects can be open, but there are some commonalities to open projects, a list of basic ingredients for working open:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A great <strong>idea of something amazing to make or build</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>clear intention to share</strong> your idea, project and process widely</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A group of <strong>contributors, which form a community</strong> to shape and drive your project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>world wide web</strong> to connect and collaborate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A project leader</strong> (this is you!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A series of <strong>open practices and tools</strong> for planning, project management, mentorship, growing a community and running events, which weâ€™ll cover in this training.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By working open, we can often get far more done (and often done better) than we could working alone. And the knowledge, 
resources, and tools we generate in our work are more useful and powerful because theyâ€™re shared widely. Now that 
youâ€™ve seen how working open happens in real life, and have a better sense of whatâ€™s a project needs to be open,
 itâ€™s time to explore what it means to actually lead an open project. Continue to the next module to learn more.</p> -->


<p><strong>Choosing a venue</strong></p>

<p>Physical accessibility of a venue is crucial for inclusion of persons with disabilities. 
Establishments in India are obliged to make their premises accessible in accordance with the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016)<sup>2</sup>. When we say a venue has 'barrier-free' entry, 
what we mean is that there are no obstacles such as steps, debris and uneven surfaces that come 
in the way of a person accessing a particular space. In the experience of many people who have 
organized inclusive events, asking someone whether a venue is accessible and actually visiting it 
and seeing it for yourself may be two very different experiences. The question for evaluating accessibility 
should not be, "Can we get someone with a wheelchair inside the venue?" because many wheelchair users 
do not feel comfortable being physically lifted or carried by other people. The question to pose is, 
"Can a wheelchair user enter the area with minimum effort and assistance?" The best way to verify 
accessibility of a place is through the engagement of an access auditor or accessibility consultant. 
The Government of India has recently approved of a list of auditors as part of their Accessible India 
Campaign that you can find here<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>Do: Make a visit and examine all the areas of the venue that you think will be accessed by 
participants to your event, possibly with a person who has a locomotor impairment.</p>
<p>Don't: Rely on the opinion of an unknown person or the management of a venue about its accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> costs for an accessibility audit, including travel to and from the venues.</p>
<p>When an entrance is slightly elevated, a temporary ramp does a good job of making the 
premises barrier-free. Note, however, that all ramps are not created equal. The Americans
with Disabilities Act recommends a 1:12 slope, which means that every 1 inch of vertical rise 
requires at least 1 foot (12 inches) of ramp length, or in other words, 5 degrees of incline<sup>4</sup>. T
his is necessary in order to keep the ramp from being excessively steep and thus laborious to navigate. 
The owners of the venue should be able to do this for you, failing which you can look for options to rent a temporary ramp.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> renting an accessible ramp<sup>5</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Bathrooms</strong></p>
<p>It is really important that bathrooms are accessible for persons with disabilities. Many persons with 
disabilities have conditions that cause them to use the bathroom frequently and they are unable to 'hold it in' 
for long periods of time, say, until they reach home. Inaccessibility of accessible bathrooms lead to a host of 
other health issues such as urinary tract infections. It is important that the bathrooms are clean and dry as many 
persons with disabilities may find a slippery floor inaccessible. An accessibility consultant should be able to 
verify the accessibility of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Even if the bathroom is not fully accessible, have a talk with the management of the venue about attaching 
a grab bar in at least one toilet stall in each bathroom and ensure a relatively slip-free environment6. This 
is also useful for the elderly who may be attending the event.</p>
<p>Do: Many venues are not averse to making their premises accessible, but they have no idea how to do it. 
Providing the venue management with accessibility standards and guidance may result in positive changes. 
If you have a sufficient amount of time before your event takes place, then the management can affect these 
changes in time to benefit your participants.</p>
<p>Don't: Encourage the venue management to start construction work towards accessibility if your event 
is coming up soon. In the event of incomplete work, the debris and construction material will pose a greater 
barrier for persons with disabilities who may attend your event.</p>
<p><i>[ <strong>Editor's note:</strong> One or more steps are usually constructed at the entrance of most Indian bathrooms, 
which makes it impossible for wheelchair users to enter them. This small but crucial detail makes a big 
difference in their lives: Some are unable to take up employment, some avoid going to events altogether. 
Considering the state of sanitation facilities and practices in India, this is often an overlooked aspect.]</i></p>
