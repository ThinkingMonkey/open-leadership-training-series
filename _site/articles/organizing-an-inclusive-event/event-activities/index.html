<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>When youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re leading an open project, there are a few things youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll do, listed below in the order theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll likely happen on your project. Some of these practices (such as working with volunteers) arenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t so unusual, but in an open project the notions of community involvement and information-sharing become core, driving principles. When you work open you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Invite others to work on the projectÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ anyone with some level of skill who has an interest can pitch in. These are your project contributors, who volunteer their time and skills to your project. YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll learn more about contributors in Section 3 of this training).</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide information, help, and encouragement to any contributor working on your project, and connect them with their fellow contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Encourage this community of contributors to participate in project decision-making and planning, and make these conversations as public as possible.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>With intention and thoughtfulness, make both the end product of your project and the process you used to get there widely and freely accessible to all, for use and reuse.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these points deals with making a project <strong>participatory (getting new people involved)</strong> and <strong>transparent (sharing information about the project widely, in a way thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s useful for others).</strong> Every project is different, and some of the points above may be less relevant to your project, while others will be at its core. Some projects will implement these elements slowly, while others may work fully in the open from day one. No matter how you do it, you can think of working open as a way of working that invites outsidersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ those who might otherwise have little or no part in project work, creation, and decision-makingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ to become insiders in those aspects of the project. You can do this is by building trust in your community of collaborators.</p>

</video>

<p>To recap, here are ways that you can build trust on your project.</p>

<p>To show that you trust and value those in your community, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Listen to and respect the views and approaches of your contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide contributors with truly important, meaningful work to do on the project.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Give up some control of the project to your contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To secure the trust of members of your community, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be consistent and prompt in communicating with them.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Follow through and execute project work as planned.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Show that the project is solid, and worthy of their time and energy.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-working-open-can-and-cant-do-for-you">What Working Open Can (and CanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t) Do for You</h3>

<p>As Project Lead, you also need to have a good grasp of the possibilities and limitations of working open, and realistic expectations of what it can (and canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t) do for your project.</p>

<p>As project lead, you need to ask yourself, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s the value of opening my project to community contribution and collaboration?ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Below weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve outlined some benefits of working open.</p>

<p><strong>Working open can sharpen your thinking and help you find errors you hadnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t realized youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢d made.</strong> Having many contributors on your project means you benefit from different approaches and ways of thinkingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ a contributor might offer a totally novel solution to a design problem that would never occur to you. Diverse perspectives produce a better, richer product. Contributors may also catch errors that youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve missed. In the world of software engineering, this is expressed in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“many eyesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ principle, or LinusÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Law: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ In other words, the more people involved, the more likely someone is to spot an error or come up with a novel approach. And the process of mentoring contributors can enhance and deepen your own skillsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ you may find efficiencies or better ways of working as you help contributors solve problems or tackle new chunks of creative work.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is a way to incorporate user-centric thinking in the design and creation of your project.</strong> Many projectsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ from web apps or tools to advocacy campaigns to learning materialsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ languish because they never find an audience. By inviting a broad community to contribute to your project, you can integrate your target audience into the development process to help ensure that youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re creating a tool, experience, or resource that meets their needs. Future users can be involved in decision-making about project design, direction, and features, as well as contributing project work. They can provide invaluable insights during user testing and evaluation of anything you make. In the words of Aspiration technologyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Allen Gunn:</p>

<p>ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“I believe in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œmany eyesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ principleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ but also in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œmany hearts and soulsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ principle. Having many personalities, values and experience-sets involved in creating something intrinsically makes the finished product more robust and broadly relevant ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ versus, say, three privileged white guys in Silicon Valley kicking something out.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½</p>

<p><strong>Working open can allow your project to achieve its maximum impact.</strong> When youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re engaging contributors and target users from day one, your final product will launch to a built-in audience and be more likely to be supported, championed and sustained by contributors with a long history with the project. When you share your process and making ongoing work openly available on the web, others can build on your work, adapt your process or a part of your project for a novel use. Your project can have positive, transformative effects far beyond what youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re able to imagine.</p>

<p>Working open can help your project flourish and grow, but there are also many misconceptions about the practice. LetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s address a few common confusions about working open, and get at some of the challenges inherent in this way of working.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to get free software engineering work or other kinds labor for your project, without providing anything in return.</strong> In a successful open project, volunteers will contribute time, energy and work, but if you open your project solely for the purpose of getting resources for free and you treat your contributors only as unpaid laborers, your contributors wonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t stick around and your project will fail. Contributors on an open project should gain as much (if not more) than they give to the project, though not as monetary compensation. As an open project lead, youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll need to figure out how to engage contributors in ways that are meaningful and valuable to them, appreciate and reward them, and create system of shared decision-making, mentorship, and skill sharing so that contributors grow and benefit along with the project. More about this in Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to hit your deadline faster.</strong> On an open project with a sizable community of enthusiastic contributors, you might think that work gets done rapidly and efficiently. And in some instances that can be true. But you should be prepared for the reality that it takes time and energy build a functional community of people who work well together. YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll spend less time working directly on the project while you coordinate contributors and contributions, a task that requires intention, mindfulness, and consistent effort. Again, weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll talk more about this in Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to avoid process or structure.</strong> Because decision-making is shared by the community and everyone pitches in as they like, it may seem like thereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s no need to create roles on a project or define a system or series of steps to for contributors to followÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ why not just keep it casual? Actually, good open projects should provide clear guidelines and a coherent process so new contributors know what to do and what to expect as they make their first contributions. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s helpful to have rolesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ even if these are lightweight and somewhat flexibleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ so itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s clear who contributors can go to for help or who might approve or review a contribution they make. Any power structures or decision making processes need to be transparent, so contributors feel encouraged to participate meaningfully in shaping the direction of the project. WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll discuss good, transparent project set-up in Section 2.</p>

<h3 id="assignment--reflecting-on-benefits-and-challenges-of-working-open"><span class="assignment">Assignment: </span> Reflecting on Benefits and Challenges of Working Open</h3>

<p>Reflect on what the benefits, challenges, and limitations of working open might mean for your project. For example, how do you envision your project specifically benefiting from more community contribution and participation? How do you feel about the need for well-defined process and structure on this project? Take about 4 or 5 minutes to write out your thoughts on this. If working in a group, you can write your reflections on sticky notes and then share and discuss together.</p>
 -->
<p><strong>Group exercises</strong></p>
<p>Group exercises should be planned in a universally designed manner. The number 
of facilitators or trainers should be commensurate with the number of groups so 
that persons who have various limitations are not left behind or excluded. When 
allocating time for the exercises, bear in mind that participants who require 
interpreters et cetera may need more time to complete their tasks/ activities 
than those do not need someone to help them.</p>

<p><strong>Slide decks</strong></p>
<p>Using a slide deck can be inclusive towards a whole bunch of people while excluding others. 
Here are some tips for an inclusive presentation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Don't fill the slides with text. Use concise sentences to summarize the key points.</li>
  <li>Do use and refer to pictorial representations or illustrations of the topic you are talking about.
   This also is helpful for people who are not well-acquainted with the English language.</li>
  <li>Do use simple flowcharts and diagrams to show processes.</li>
  <li>Do explain pictorial representations for the benefit of the visually impaired participants 
  before you begin explaining the slide.</li>
  <li>Don't use flashy animation on your slides.</li>
  <li>Don't read aloud the contents of every slide verbatim as a way of explaining it to visually impaired participants, 
  if the contents are a summary of what you will be elaborating on during your presentation.</li>
  <li>Do read aloud the specific content of the slide if it is a quote, an extract of a study, or a law. For example, 
  when referring to it during the course of your presentation/ talk.</li>
  <li>Don't avoid using graphs and other representations of statistics on your slides. 
  You can read out the values of the graph at the start of your explanation.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Audio-visual content</strong></p>
<p>All audio visual content should be subtitled, or preferably, close-captioned<sup>14</sup>. 
If a video contains substantial amounts of visual content that does not get conveyed through 
its dialogue or sound (think, a movie from the silent era, or a documentary where a voiceover 
is juxtaposed over scenes from the real world), check if the visual content has been 
audio-described somewhere<sup>15</sup>. If not, you may audio-describe it yourself. Watch the film/ video 
a few times to know what to expect when so you start preparing and recording the 
audio-description. If it is not feasible to explain the content of the video over a microphone, 
you may sit beside the visually impaired person and audio-describe it to them as the video plays.</p>

<p><strong>"Icebreakers", "energizers" or other activities</strong></p>
<p>Often events have short exercises, which are meant for participants to loosen up, 
get to know each other better, or recover energy levels after intense sessions of 
learning. You do not have to avoid these activities because there are persons with 
disabilities in the room. There are many activities in which people with disabilities
can participate. A search on the Internet will yield ideas for several such activities<sup>16</sup>, 
even for groups of persons with visual impairment<sup>17</sup>. Do not avoid activities that involve dancing, 
if there are Deaf people in the room. Just make sure they are included in the synchronized dance moves!</p>

<p><strong>Scheduling</strong></p>
<p>Scheduling is very important in making events more inclusive. Organizers 
should ensure that days are planned with enough breaks between sessions. 
Breaks are not meant only for visiting the bathroom or having tea. Interpreters 
and support persons need time to rest, persons with disabilities may take a little 
longer than non-disabled people to use the bathroom, and for most people, concentrating 
beyond 90 minutes at a stretch is not ideal. Plan for sessions lasting 90 minutes followed 
by a break with refreshments. The breaks may range from 15 to 30 minutes. Allocate at least 
half an hour for the lunch break, so that participants and their support staff can eat and 
be refreshed for the next session. If the sessions are long and intense, and if it would 
facilitate the participation of some persons with disabilities, you may also consider 
brief 2-3 minute 'sensory breaks' where participants remain in the room but the event is briefly suspended.</p>

<p><strong>The after-party</strong></p>
<p>Events are valuable because of the give and take of knowledge and opportunities 
for networking with peers. Many events are followed by an informal gathering where 
participants are encouraged to mingle over food and drink. Check if the after-party 
space is accessible and navigable for wheelchair-users and other persons with disability. 
Organizers and the teams should know and imbibe disability etiquette<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> a venue that is accessible for persons with disabilities</p>

<p><strong>Emergency evacuation</strong></p>
<p>Premises can be easily evacuable in case of an emergency. One of the first things you 
should explain to participants is the exit plan. Wheelchairs and stretchers should be available 
to help evacuate persons with limited mobility. In case of people who have other impairments 
that may hinder them from reaching the emergency exit in time, and who do not have personal assistants, 
create a buddy system where a willing co-participant will help escort the person to safety.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> printing evacuation routes and renting wheelchairs and stretchers.</p>

<p><strong>Reasonable accommodation</strong></p>
<p>No matter how inclusive an event you plan, some participants may face barriers 
to their full inclusion. This is especially true of people with psychosocial disabilities, 
autism or chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Reasonable accommodation is defined by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
as "…necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or 
undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the 
enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms"<sup>19</sup>. In other words, reasonable accommodation refers to small adjustments 
that an organizer can make to the event to ensure that a participant with a disability can 
participate on an equal basis with others. These adjustments are made notwithstanding the 
measures already taken for accessibility and design of the event. However, the adjustments 
should not impose a disproportionate or undue burden on the organizer. Moreover, 
the provision of reasonable accommodation happens through a dialogue between the 
organizer and the participant, which considers the measures or adjustments that are 
feasible within various constraints such as those imposed by monetary budgets. Requests 
for reasonable accommodation should ideally be made in advance, though some issues may 
come up on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>It is not useful to provide a list of possible reasonable accommodations because lists 
always turn out prescriptive. However, there are examples in the context of education and 
the Americans with Disabilities Act<sup>20</sup>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Captions for people who are hard of hearing.</li>
  <li>Allowing a person with chronic fatigue to lie down on a bed and attend a workshop.</li>
  <li>Allowing a service animal (like a guide dog for a person with visual impairment) to enter a premises.</li>
  <li>Organizing a personal assistant on the request of a person with disability.</li>
  <li>Providing handouts in large font sizes for people who have low vision.</li>
  <li>Arranging for a participant to eat lunch earlier than others because of medication they are taking.</li>
  <li>Allowing a person with anxiety to do individual work instead of a group exercise.</li>
  <li>Providing warm clothing for a person who feels extremely cold in the venue but the 
  temperature is not a problem for others.</li>
  <li>Paying a travel allowance for a person with a disability for whom public transport is inaccessible.</li>
  <li>Allowing people to bring their own accessibility aids to be used on computers belonging to another 
  organization for a hackathon etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you provide an option for participants to state their reasonable 
accommodation needs in advance, you can also designate a member of the organization 
team to be contacted to discuss various options. Reasonable accommodation is a new 
term even in the disability sector so many people are still trying to understand 
what it means in their respective contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> A reasonable accommodation fund (5 to 10% of the total budget can be kept aside for this.)</p>

<p><strong>Residential events</strong></p>
<p>In the case of events where participants staying at a venue overnight or for a few days, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The entire premises should be accessible. It is unfortunate when people with disabilities 
  have to order room service because the restaurants or dining hall are not accessible. 
  This prevents them from hanging out with their peers.</li>
  <li>If the person requires personal assistance, they may need to hire a separate person 
  to provide support for the second half of the day.</li>
  <li>Plan late evening events sparingly. People may need to rest or change assistive 
  devices and might not be comfortable returning to a work setting in the evenings. 
  Have an honest conversation with your participants before planning an event late in the evening or night.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have the details of accessible healthcare centres, in the 
  vicinity of the event's venue in case of an emergency.</li>
  <li>Provide details of nearby pharmacies, supermarkets or restaurants in the information 
  sheet. Indicate whether they are wheelchair accessible or not.</li>
</ol>
