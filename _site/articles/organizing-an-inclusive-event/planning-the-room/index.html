  <h2>
    Planning the room
  </h2>
</div>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>
<p>It is important to plan the layout of the room to facilitate full participation. An 
auditorium-like setting of chairs is not very accessible for wheelchair users, or people 
who may need to move around during sessions. For most events, arranging several tables and 
chairs around them are the best way to ensure accessibility and comfort of participants. 
There should be enough space around the tables to manoeuvre wheelchairs. Ensure that there 
are electrical extension points or outlets or spike-busters placed under each table so that 
people can plug in their electronic devices; power cords and wires on the floor could cause 
people to trip over them.</p>
<p>The projection screen, monitors, et cetera should be placed in such a way that all participants
 can see them. If necessary and possible, use two or more screens or monitors.</p>
<p>Use microphones. If there are one or two lead trainers, let them use lapel mics, and keep 
cordless mics for the participants. Ensure that audio equipment is checked and tuned in advance 
in order to avoid disturbance (screeching sounds) from the equipment that can trigger or cause 
discomfort to people with sensitivity to loud and high-pitched noises.</p>
<p>If you have a visually impaired participant, offer to help orient them with the room layout so they know where everything is.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> table and chair rental, electrical extension points or spike-busters.</p>


<p><strong>Sign language interpreters</strong></p>
<p>Speakers should be in the line of sight of participants at all times. Some participants may 
have to be seated closer to the speakers if they rely on lip reading.</p>

<p>Sign language interpreters are meant to stand close to the speakers so that the audience can 
see them both together. If a session requires a speaker to deliver the lecture from a different 
part of the room, the interpreter must also have space to stand next to them there. The arrangement 
of the room should be such that people entering or exiting the room during the session should not 
obstruct the participants' view of the interpreter while leaving the room in the middle of the session.</p>
<p>Hire two sign language interpreters as interpretation is a very intense job. They can take turns 
among themselves to do the interpretation. If you have invited a Deaf7 participant, or if you have 
received a confirmation from a Deaf participant, ask them who they would prefer as a sign language 
interpreter and try your best to engage those persons.</p>
<p><i>Do: Anyone who wants to speak with the Deaf participant should directly address the 
participant in the second person (e.g., "Have you understood this concept?"), so that the interpreter can convey it.</i></p>
<p><i>Don't: Address questions meant for the participant to the interpreter. (e.g., "Has she understood the concept?")</i></p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> Sign language interpreters</p>


<p><strong>Quiet corner</strong></p>
<p>Some participants, especially those with mental illness, psychosocial disabilities or autism, 
may get triggered or overstimulated at the event. They might need to take a break and go to a 
quiet place that is outside the event spaces or fenced off from them where can stay until they 
feel ready to go back to the event. If the event venue is within the premises of a hotel, it may 
entitle one to reserve a free room, which can be designated for this purpose. Else, you can arrange 
for some comfortable seating in a corner at the back of the room for quiet time.</p> 

<p><strong>Photography and videography</strong></p>
<p>In events specifically for persons with disabilities, especially psychosocial disabilities, many 
persons may not want to be photographed or identified as persons with a mental illness. This may be 
because of their concerns over being stigmatised, judged or discriminated against in different aspects 
of their lives. It is important to seek the permission of persons in events before the event is 
photographed or videographed. Even if people have consented to be photographed, do consider that 
many persons with conditions such as autism and photosensitive epilepsy may be triggered by the 
use of the camera's flash on them. Speakers or trainers with such impairments may be also be 
distracted by the sound of clicking cameras.</p>
<i><p><strong>[Editor's note:</strong> Wikimedia events usually have their own protocol about photographing and
videographing participants. Colour-coded lanyards, badges or similar markers are distributed
to those who do not wish to have their photos or videos taken or those who would prefer
being explicitly asked for permission before they are photographed or videographed.</p>
<p>Information about colour-codes and their meaning is usually indicated at the Registration
Desk or wherever lanyards or other markers are distributed to participants, in the Welcome/
Registration Kit and included in the Friendly Space Policy for the event.</p>
<p>Some events have demarcated no-photography areas within spaces such as auditoriums
and seminar halls. This seating arrangement allows for cameras to be used inside the room
without certain sections of the audience coming into the frame.]</p></i>
<p><strong>Planned seating</strong></p> 
<p>Other kinds of interpreters (e.g., for those with learning disabilities), scribes and some personal
 assistants will need to sit next to the participant. Some participants may be comfortable only in a
  certain part of the room and would like to keep that seating even after breaks. Facilitators may
   ensure that this need or preference is respected.</p>
