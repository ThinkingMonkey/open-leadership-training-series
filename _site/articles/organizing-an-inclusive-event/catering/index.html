<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re leading an open project, there are a few things youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do, listed below in the order theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll likely happen on your project. Some of these practices (such as working with volunteers) arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so unusual, but in an open project the notions of community involvement and information-sharing become core, driving principles. When you work open you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Invite others to work on the projectÃ¢â‚¬â€œ anyone with some level of skill who has an interest can pitch in. These are your project contributors, who volunteer their time and skills to your project. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn more about contributors in Section 3 of this training).</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide information, help, and encouragement to any contributor working on your project, and connect them with their fellow contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Encourage this community of contributors to participate in project decision-making and planning, and make these conversations as public as possible.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>With intention and thoughtfulness, make both the end product of your project and the process you used to get there widely and freely accessible to all, for use and reuse.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these points deals with making a project <strong>participatory (getting new people involved)</strong> and <strong>transparent (sharing information about the project widely, in a way thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s useful for others).</strong> Every project is different, and some of the points above may be less relevant to your project, while others will be at its core. Some projects will implement these elements slowly, while others may work fully in the open from day one. No matter how you do it, you can think of working open as a way of working that invites outsidersÃ¢â‚¬â€œ those who might otherwise have little or no part in project work, creation, and decision-makingÃ¢â‚¬â€œ to become insiders in those aspects of the project. You can do this is by building trust in your community of collaborators.</p>

<h4 id="-creating-trust-on-an-open-project-abby-cabunoc-mayes"><span class="video-player"></span> Creating Trust on an Open Project, Abby Cabunoc Mayes</h4>

<video width="100%" height="auto" controls="">
    <source src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/2Egul1krQXaCeNTqfZGN" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>To recap, here are ways that you can build trust on your project.</p>

<p>To show that you trust and value those in your community, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Listen to and respect the views and approaches of your contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide contributors with truly important, meaningful work to do on the project.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Give up some control of the project to your contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To secure the trust of members of your community, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be consistent and prompt in communicating with them.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Follow through and execute project work as planned.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Show that the project is solid, and worthy of their time and energy.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-working-open-can-and-cant-do-for-you">What Working Open Can (and CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t) Do for You</h3>

<p>As Project Lead, you also need to have a good grasp of the possibilities and limitations of working open, and realistic expectations of what it can (and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t) do for your project.</p>

<p>As project lead, you need to ask yourself, Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the value of opening my project to community contribution and collaboration?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Below weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve outlined some benefits of working open.</p>

<p><strong>Working open can sharpen your thinking and help you find errors you hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realized youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d made.</strong> Having many contributors on your project means you benefit from different approaches and ways of thinkingÃ¢â‚¬â€œ a contributor might offer a totally novel solution to a design problem that would never occur to you. Diverse perspectives produce a better, richer product. Contributors may also catch errors that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve missed. In the world of software engineering, this is expressed in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“many eyesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ principle, or LinusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Law: Ã¢â‚¬Å“given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In other words, the more people involved, the more likely someone is to spot an error or come up with a novel approach. And the process of mentoring contributors can enhance and deepen your own skillsÃ¢â‚¬â€œ you may find efficiencies or better ways of working as you help contributors solve problems or tackle new chunks of creative work.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is a way to incorporate user-centric thinking in the design and creation of your project.</strong> Many projectsÃ¢â‚¬â€œ from web apps or tools to advocacy campaigns to learning materialsÃ¢â‚¬â€œ languish because they never find an audience. By inviting a broad community to contribute to your project, you can integrate your target audience into the development process to help ensure that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re creating a tool, experience, or resource that meets their needs. Future users can be involved in decision-making about project design, direction, and features, as well as contributing project work. They can provide invaluable insights during user testing and evaluation of anything you make. In the words of Aspiration technologyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Allen Gunn:</p>

<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“I believe in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmany eyesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ principleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€� but also in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmany hearts and soulsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ principle. Having many personalities, values and experience-sets involved in creating something intrinsically makes the finished product more robust and broadly relevant Ã¢â‚¬â€� versus, say, three privileged white guys in Silicon Valley kicking something out.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½</p>

<p><strong>Working open can allow your project to achieve its maximum impact.</strong> When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re engaging contributors and target users from day one, your final product will launch to a built-in audience and be more likely to be supported, championed and sustained by contributors with a long history with the project. When you share your process and making ongoing work openly available on the web, others can build on your work, adapt your process or a part of your project for a novel use. Your project can have positive, transformative effects far beyond what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able to imagine.</p>

<p>Working open can help your project flourish and grow, but there are also many misconceptions about the practice. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s address a few common confusions about working open, and get at some of the challenges inherent in this way of working.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to get free software engineering work or other kinds labor for your project, without providing anything in return.</strong> In a successful open project, volunteers will contribute time, energy and work, but if you open your project solely for the purpose of getting resources for free and you treat your contributors only as unpaid laborers, your contributors wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stick around and your project will fail. Contributors on an open project should gain as much (if not more) than they give to the project, though not as monetary compensation. As an open project lead, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to figure out how to engage contributors in ways that are meaningful and valuable to them, appreciate and reward them, and create system of shared decision-making, mentorship, and skill sharing so that contributors grow and benefit along with the project. More about this in Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to hit your deadline faster.</strong> On an open project with a sizable community of enthusiastic contributors, you might think that work gets done rapidly and efficiently. And in some instances that can be true. But you should be prepared for the reality that it takes time and energy build a functional community of people who work well together. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll spend less time working directly on the project while you coordinate contributors and contributions, a task that requires intention, mindfulness, and consistent effort. Again, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll talk more about this in Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to avoid process or structure.</strong> Because decision-making is shared by the community and everyone pitches in as they like, it may seem like thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no need to create roles on a project or define a system or series of steps to for contributors to followÃ¢â‚¬â€œ why not just keep it casual? Actually, good open projects should provide clear guidelines and a coherent process so new contributors know what to do and what to expect as they make their first contributions. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s helpful to have rolesÃ¢â‚¬â€œ even if these are lightweight and somewhat flexibleÃ¢â‚¬â€œ so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear who contributors can go to for help or who might approve or review a contribution they make. Any power structures or decision making processes need to be transparent, so contributors feel encouraged to participate meaningfully in shaping the direction of the project. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discuss good, transparent project set-up in Section 2.</p>

<h3 id="assignment--reflecting-on-benefits-and-challenges-of-working-open"><span class="assignment">Assignment: </span> Reflecting on Benefits and Challenges of Working Open</h3>

<p>Reflect on what the benefits, challenges, and limitations of working open might mean for your project. For example, how do you envision your project specifically benefiting from more community contribution and participation? How do you feel about the need for well-defined process and structure on this project? Take about 4 or 5 minutes to write out your thoughts on this. If working in a group, you can write your reflections on sticky notes and then share and discuss together.</p>
 -->
<p><strong>Catering(or not)</strong></p>
<p>For daylong events, food becomes a question. Some organizers will opt to arrange 
for food for participants. Some organizers expect participants to head outside the venue 
during the lunch break to eat at a nearby restaurant or the canteen facility at the venue.</p>

<p><strong>Non-catered events</strong></p>
<p>If you expect your participants to make their own arrangements for lunch, ensure that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Participants have sufficient advance notice of this.</li>
  <li>The canteen facility is affordable and accessible.</li>
  <li>If there is no canteen facility, the nearby restaurant options that are accessible 
  for persons with disabilities are affordable.</li>
  <li>If there are no affordable and accessible restaurants nearby, all participants 
  with disabilities should be given the option of ordering takeout lunch (at their own cost, 
  if that is how everyone else is doing it) from a nearby restaurant that can be picked up 
  and delivered during the lunch break. If possible, provide them with the menus of all the
   nearby restaurants that may provide this service.</li>
  <li>There is a clean and accessible space for people to eat their packed lunches.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Don't: make a separate eating arrangement only for persons with disabilities as this may 
make them feel segregated or cut off from the rest of the participants.</i></p>

<p><strong>Catered events</strong></p>
<p>For events where catering is provided, it is a good idea to include questions about the 
dietary preferences and restrictions of participants in the confirmation sheet (See section 
titled "Confirmation sheet" below). Budget constraints may not allow you to cater to every 
individual's needs, but you can at least be advised of the options and do what you can within
 your limitations. One good practice is to label each meal item with common dietary preferences
  and intolerances/ allergies - vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free or contains gluten, fish, eggs, 
  lactose-free, dairy product, et cetera. If any participant has a food allergy, discuss with
   your caterer the possibility of preparing an allergen-free meal only for them. Confirm with
    the participant if this is acceptable to them. In general, ensure the meal has enough options
     for protein, fat and complex carbohydrates.</p> 
     
<p>As far as possible, opt for reusable sturdy tableware for participants. Also, organize for
 tables and chairs to sit and eat food for those participants who may want to do so.</p>
<p>Some participants with disabilities may require support to pick up food from a buffet. 
This can be offered in two ways.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A support person accompanies the participant to the buffet, tells them what items are available,
   asks them the items and the quantity that they would like, and serves the meal to them.</li>
  <li>A support person informs the participant, who is seated at a table, of the items on offer in the
   buffet. The participant responds with the names of the items and quantities they would like. The 
   support person then fills the plate accordingly and places it in front of the participant. In case
    of a visually impaired participant, with their permission, hold their hand and place it above each 
    different item of food to explain where each item is. Ensure that a support person is available to 
    get refills of whatever the participant would like more of.</li>
</ul>     
<p>Some participants may need feeding support. Usually this is provided by a support person or a friend, 
but in case they come alone and request this support, it should be given to them in a dignified manner.</p>

<p><strong>Beverages</strong></p>
<p>We are all trying to reduce the use of plastics and so may opt for renting glasses to be refilled 
from a bubble top canister or water cooler by the participants themselves. Please be mindful of participants
 who may need support for this. In the information document (See section titled "Information sheet" below)
  you may inform participants to bring their own bottles or cups to drink from. In case of tea and coffee,
   ensure that dairy-free and sugar-free options are available.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> drinking water and straws, glasses where necessary</p>
