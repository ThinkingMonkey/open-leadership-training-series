<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>When youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re leading an open project, there are a few things youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll do, listed below in the order theyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll likely happen on your project. Some of these practices (such as working with volunteers) arenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t so unusual, but in an open project the notions of community involvement and information-sharing become core, driving principles. When you work open you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Invite others to work on the projectÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ anyone with some level of skill who has an interest can pitch in. These are your project contributors, who volunteer their time and skills to your project. YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll learn more about contributors in Section 3 of this training).</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide information, help, and encouragement to any contributor working on your project, and connect them with their fellow contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Encourage this community of contributors to participate in project decision-making and planning, and make these conversations as public as possible.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>With intention and thoughtfulness, make both the end product of your project and the process you used to get there widely and freely accessible to all, for use and reuse.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these points deals with making a project <strong>participatory (getting new people involved)</strong> and <strong>transparent (sharing information about the project widely, in a way thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s useful for others).</strong> Every project is different, and some of the points above may be less relevant to your project, while others will be at its core. Some projects will implement these elements slowly, while others may work fully in the open from day one. No matter how you do it, you can think of working open as a way of working that invites outsidersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ those who might otherwise have little or no part in project work, creation, and decision-makingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ to become insiders in those aspects of the project. You can do this is by building trust in your community of collaborators.</p>

    <source src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/2Egul1krQXaCeNTqfZGN" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>To recap, here are ways that you can build trust on your project.</p>

<p>To show that you trust and value those in your community, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Listen to and respect the views and approaches of your contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide contributors with truly important, meaningful work to do on the project.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Give up some control of the project to your contributors.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To secure the trust of members of your community, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be consistent and prompt in communicating with them.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Follow through and execute project work as planned.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Show that the project is solid, and worthy of their time and energy.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-working-open-can-and-cant-do-for-you">What Working Open Can (and CanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t) Do for You</h3>

<p>As Project Lead, you also need to have a good grasp of the possibilities and limitations of working open, and realistic expectations of what it can (and canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t) do for your project.</p>

<p>As project lead, you need to ask yourself, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s the value of opening my project to community contribution and collaboration?ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Below weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve outlined some benefits of working open.</p>

<p><strong>Working open can sharpen your thinking and help you find errors you hadnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t realized youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢d made.</strong> Having many contributors on your project means you benefit from different approaches and ways of thinkingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ a contributor might offer a totally novel solution to a design problem that would never occur to you. Diverse perspectives produce a better, richer product. Contributors may also catch errors that youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve missed. In the world of software engineering, this is expressed in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“many eyesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ principle, or LinusÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Law: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ In other words, the more people involved, the more likely someone is to spot an error or come up with a novel approach. And the process of mentoring contributors can enhance and deepen your own skillsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ you may find efficiencies or better ways of working as you help contributors solve problems or tackle new chunks of creative work.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is a way to incorporate user-centric thinking in the design and creation of your project.</strong> Many projectsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ from web apps or tools to advocacy campaigns to learning materialsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ languish because they never find an audience. By inviting a broad community to contribute to your project, you can integrate your target audience into the development process to help ensure that youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re creating a tool, experience, or resource that meets their needs. Future users can be involved in decision-making about project design, direction, and features, as well as contributing project work. They can provide invaluable insights during user testing and evaluation of anything you make. In the words of Aspiration technologyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Allen Gunn:</p>

<p>ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“I believe in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œmany eyesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ principleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ but also in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œmany hearts and soulsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ principle. Having many personalities, values and experience-sets involved in creating something intrinsically makes the finished product more robust and broadly relevant ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ versus, say, three privileged white guys in Silicon Valley kicking something out.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½</p>

<p><strong>Working open can allow your project to achieve its maximum impact.</strong> When youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re engaging contributors and target users from day one, your final product will launch to a built-in audience and be more likely to be supported, championed and sustained by contributors with a long history with the project. When you share your process and making ongoing work openly available on the web, others can build on your work, adapt your process or a part of your project for a novel use. Your project can have positive, transformative effects far beyond what youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re able to imagine.</p>

<p>Working open can help your project flourish and grow, but there are also many misconceptions about the practice. LetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s address a few common confusions about working open, and get at some of the challenges inherent in this way of working.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to get free software engineering work or other kinds labor for your project, without providing anything in return.</strong> In a successful open project, volunteers will contribute time, energy and work, but if you open your project solely for the purpose of getting resources for free and you treat your contributors only as unpaid laborers, your contributors wonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t stick around and your project will fail. Contributors on an open project should gain as much (if not more) than they give to the project, though not as monetary compensation. As an open project lead, youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll need to figure out how to engage contributors in ways that are meaningful and valuable to them, appreciate and reward them, and create system of shared decision-making, mentorship, and skill sharing so that contributors grow and benefit along with the project. More about this in Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to hit your deadline faster.</strong> On an open project with a sizable community of enthusiastic contributors, you might think that work gets done rapidly and efficiently. And in some instances that can be true. But you should be prepared for the reality that it takes time and energy build a functional community of people who work well together. YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll spend less time working directly on the project while you coordinate contributors and contributions, a task that requires intention, mindfulness, and consistent effort. Again, weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll talk more about this in Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>Working open is not a way to avoid process or structure.</strong> Because decision-making is shared by the community and everyone pitches in as they like, it may seem like thereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s no need to create roles on a project or define a system or series of steps to for contributors to followÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ why not just keep it casual? Actually, good open projects should provide clear guidelines and a coherent process so new contributors know what to do and what to expect as they make their first contributions. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s helpful to have rolesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ even if these are lightweight and somewhat flexibleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ so itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s clear who contributors can go to for help or who might approve or review a contribution they make. Any power structures or decision making processes need to be transparent, so contributors feel encouraged to participate meaningfully in shaping the direction of the project. WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll discuss good, transparent project set-up in Section 2.</p>

<h3 id="assignment--reflecting-on-benefits-and-challenges-of-working-open"><span class="assignment">Assignment: </span> Reflecting on Benefits and Challenges of Working Open</h3>

<p>Reflect on what the benefits, challenges, and limitations of working open might mean for your project. For example, how do you envision your project specifically benefiting from more community contribution and participation? How do you feel about the need for well-defined process and structure on this project? Take about 4 or 5 minutes to write out your thoughts on this. If working in a group, you can write your reflections on sticky notes and then share and discuss together.</p>
 -->
<p><strong>Confirmation sheet</strong></p>
<p>Unless it is a 'walk-in' event, it is ideal to provide a confirmation sheet to all 
participants who are invited or have expressed an interest to attend it. The sheet can ask for details such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Dietary intolerances/ allergies</li>
  <li>Reasonable accommodation requirements (See section titled "Reasonable accommodation" below.)</li>
  <li>Will they attend on their own or come with a support person, or would they require a support person
   to be provided by the organizers?</li>
  <li>What is their preferred means of being contacted with regards to the event and the information provided in the form?</li>
  <li>What is their preferred format for materials to be given at the event (if applicable)?</li>
</ol>
<p>You can host this form online, even via Google Forms. However, you should keep in 
mind how best to ensure that the form is accessible<sup>8</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Pre–event materials</strong></p>
<p>For some events, such as conferences or trainings, facilitators prefer that participants 
read or view some materials in advance. The most practical way to do this is to email all 
materials to all participants. Make sure that the materials are accessible to someone using 
a screen reader. Scanned copies or photos of printed materials may not be readable. Verify 
whether your documents are accessible through a colleague who uses a screen reader. If you 
do not know anyone who uses a screen reader, you can try verifying this yourself<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p>On request, materials should be made available in Braille. There are several Braille printing presses in India<sup>10</sup>. 
Organizations such as the National Association for the Blind11 and the All India Confederation of the 
Blind<sup>12</sup> run Braille printing presses. Rehabilitation and Vocational centres such as Worth Trust 
located in Chennai13 also provide these services.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> materials in Braille.</p>

<p><strong>Information sheet</strong></p>
<p>An information sheet regarding the logistics of the event should be circulated well 
in advance of the event to all confirmed participants. The document should contain details on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Date and time of the event</li>
  <li>How to reach the event venue - address, directions, Google Map location etc.</li>
  <li>Catering arrangements</li>
  <li>Draft Schedule, if available, with duration of breaks</li>
  <li>What materials will be provided to participants during the event</li>
  <li>Accessibility measures and availability of reasonable accommodations and contact person in this regard
  </li>
  <li>Specific instructions to participants, if any</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>During the event</strong></p>
<p>Display the schedule on a soft board/ noticeboard with the use of different colours 
to differentiate the sessions. The placard/ sheet of paper bearing information about each 
session can be pinned or pasted on a sheet alongside another sheet that displays only the 
time slots. This makes it easy to reschedule sessions, if necessary.</p>
<img src="/img/Image_Organizing_an_inclusive_event.png" />
<p>Example of the scheduling method described above</p>
<h3>After the event</h3>
<p><strong>Providing materials for participants to take home</strong></p>
<p>Consider environmental concerns and put materials on a USB drive. If that is 
not feasible, include a question on the confirmation sheet (See section titled 
"Confirmation sheet" above) asking the participants if they would like to take 
copies of the event handouts/ materials with them.</p>
<p>Seeking feedback after the event</p>
<p>Include questions asking participants to evaluate the arrangements made for 
accessibility and reasonable accommodation,d how included (or not) they felt in 
the event, and how you could make future editions of the event better. Ensure 
that the format of the questionnaire is accessible as explained above.</p>
<p><strong>Budget for:</strong> USB drives for take conference materials home.</p>
