  <h2>
    How can we identify epistemic violence in
online spaces?
  </h2>
</div>
<p>Identifying epistemic violence against marginalized communities in online spaces is a
complex exercise, as epistemic violence may not openly manifest itself. The processes
that enable it function in the undercurrents. Since the dehumanizing language directed at 
marginalised groups is mostly borrowed from colonial writers and those of dominant
castes, there is a tendency to subconsciously and unquestioningly accept the prevailing
nomenclature and myths. While unpacking these narratives, we will find that most of the
dominant discourses are rooted in prejudicial assumptions about communities that have
historically been marginalized through the subjective writings of the privileged sections
of the society.</p>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
<p>This short checklist for identifying visible and invisible epistemic violence against certain
sections of the society may be helpful in our critical understanding of the phenomenon:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the authorâ€™s background? How is the author related to community he/she
is writing for?</li>
<p><i>[<strong>Editorâ€™s note:</strong> The questions in this checklist refer to content in the text form, which has
been published online or in print or both. However, the questions may also be applied to
content in other forms and formats, such as videos.]</i></p>
  <li>What sources does the author quote or cite in constructing the narrative of their
writing?</li>
  <li>What kind of experience does the author posses in dealing with the subject of the
writing? Are there several other bodies of work or is it a new contribution?</li>
  <li>Where do you locate the authorâ€™s work in the local, national and international
politics on the subject? Is the author advocating on the side of the dominant
culture or the subordinate one?</li>
  <li>How does the author represent or depict women from marginalized communities?</li>
  <li>Is the narrative presented by the author a dignified and honest representation of
marginalized communities?</li>
  <li>Did the author seek the consent of the members of relevant marginalized
communities before making the writing public? Did the author gain the membersâ€™
confidence? Do the members approve of the narrative presented by the author?</li>
<p><i><strong>[Editor's note:</strong> If any mention of these processes of seeking informed consent and
gaining the trust of the community is conspicuous by its absence from the published work,
then it is an indication that the author has not carried out these processes.]</i></p>
  <li>Was the published work sufficiently reviewed by peers, that is, other authors who
have the experience of working on the specific subject of the work?</li>
  <li>Does the published work or document cautiously make efforts to disassociate
itself from patriarchal narratives and does it incorporate voices from all genders
and classes of the marginalised community?</li>
  <li>Is the narrative of marginalized communities paternalistic in approach and does it
try to infantilize its subjects?</li>
</ol>
<p><i>[<strong>Editor's note:</strong> These questions give the reader a pointer to the authorâ€™s own experience
(or lack thereof) of life as a part of a marginalised existence. This is important because
<strong>the narrative changes with the narrator</strong>. If the author does not belong to the community
they write about, then have they made an attempt to be fair, ethical and objective in their
representation of the people, and to be balanced and proportional in the importance they
give to different narratives? When the author is far removed from the subject of writing,
the outcome is rarely unbiased or just.]</i></p>
<p><strong>Exercise for learners:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify some Wikipedia articles about marginalised communities. These could be
articles on the topic of the community itself, their traditional knowledge,
practices, customs, insignia, notable people from the community, specific events
reported in the news, laws meant to protect them or their property, and so on.</li>
  <li>Take a look at the references.
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>Try to determine if the references are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" target="_blank">reliable sources [WP: RS]</a> according
to Wikipediaâ€™s policies.</li>
      <li>Is there a balance among the number and kind of references originating
from primary, secondary and tertiary sources? See Wikipediaâ€™s policy on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" target="_blank">neutral point of view [WP:NPOV]</a> for the definition of "balance" in this
context. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" target="_blank">Primary, secondary and tertiary</a> sources are defined in the policy
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" target="_blank">no original research [WP: NOR]</a>.</li>
      <li>Is the content that these references support in the article proportionate and
balanced? See WP:NPOV for the definition of â€œproportionateâ€� and
â€œbalancedâ€� in this context.</li>
      <li>If you search for references that are authored or peer-reviewed by
members of the community or the people/ organisations they are
associated with, what do you find?</li>
      <li>Who are the experts cited/ quoted in these references? Do they have
on-ground experience, that is, field experience of working with these
communities?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What content or references may be included in the article in keeping with WP:
NOR and policies against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tendentious_editing#Righting_great_wrongs" target="_blank">tendentious editing [WP: TE]</a>?</li>
