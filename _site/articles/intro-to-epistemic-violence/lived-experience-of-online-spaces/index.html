  <h2>
    How is epistemic violence defined?
  </h2>
</div>
<p>The nature of lived experiences of using the Internet as documented by people who
belong to historically marginalized backgrounds is mixed. On one hand, the Internet has
clearly provided them the opportunity to create and share their narratives from their
personal points of view and as representatives of their own communities. A very visible
online community of various marginalized groups is voicing a counter-hegemonic
discourse, step by step, providing the much-needed diversity of voices. Some prominent
examples of such online avenues in the context of the Adivasi and Dalit communities:</p>
<p><i>Adivasi Resurgence</i> (<a href="http://www.adivasiresurgence.com" target="_blank">http://www.adivasiresurgence.com</a>) makes available a platform for
members of Adivasi communities to vocalise their views on the issues that concern their
communities.</p>
<p>Round Table India (<a href="http://roundtableindia.co.in" target="_blank">http://roundtableindia.co.in</a>) is a website where Bahujan persons
write about caste, Ambedkarism and social exclusion, thus enriching the discourse on
inequalities in India.</p>
<p><i>CGNet Swara (<a href="http://cgnetswara.org" target="_blank">http://cgnetswara.org</a>)
[<strong>Editor's note:</strong> It is an <a href="http://cgnetswara.org/recognition.html" target="_blank">award-winning project</a> and a platform to discuss issues related to
the Central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana_(India)" target="_blank">Gondwana</a> region of India. CGNet Swara operates from the state of
Chattisgarh. The Gond are an indigenous group and widespread ethnic minority living in
this remote region that faces poverty, high illiteracy, armed insurgency and lack of
economic development. CGNet Swara, which was set up in 2010, has since "chalked up a
number of victories, large and small, for the Gondi-speaking villagers".<sup>3</sup> ]</i></p>
<p><i>Adivasi Hunkar (<a href="http://adivasihunkar.blogpost.com" target="_blank">http://adivasihunkar.blogpost.com</a>), Dalit Dastak
(<a href="http://dalitdastak.com" target="_blank">http://dalitdastak.com</a>) and Forward Press (<a href="www.forwardpress.in" target="_blank">www.forwardpress.in</a>)</i></p>

<h3>Experiences of epistemic violence online</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, marginalized groups face several challenges that are defeating the
democratizing purposes of the Internet. There is a very visible process of ghettoising the
marginalized communities into selective online spaces, which is reflective of "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/othering" target="_blank">othering</a>"<sup>4</sup>
traditionally done by dominant sections of the society. By sticking stigmatized and
dehumanizing labels to marginalized groups online, the discriminatory practices based on
caste, class and gender have continued. One such avenue is the collaborative
question-and-answer website <a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank">Quora</a> where its users, intentionally or otherwise, publish
unverified, derogatory and villyfing statements and opinions about India's marginalised
communities. Sample these questions about Adivasis posted on this popular website by</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do regular Tamils look like Adivasis elsewhere in India?</li>
  <li>Have you ever been looted by Adivasis while travelling in distant areas?</li>
  <li>Why do Adivasis live in jungle and not in human society?</li>
  <li>What clothes do Adivasis wear?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us examine how these online posts are harmful to the people they refer to, in this
case, Adivasis:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Why do regular Tamils look like Adivasis elsewhere in India?</i> This is a factually
incorrect and loaded question that equates dark-skinned Tamil-speaking people
with dark-skinned Adivasis. It implies that only Adivasis are supposed to be
extremely dark-skinned. Thus, it is racist towards both Adivasis and Tamils.</li>
  <li><i>Have you ever been looted by Adivasis while travelling in distant areas? [<strong>Editor's
note:</strong> This question, fallacious and loaded, perpetuates the negative stereotype
that Adivasis who live in remote, far-flung places are robbers who attack
travellers. It tries to indicate that Adivasis are, in a sense, sub-human. Another
implication is that Adivasis are criminals. The Phas&eacute; Pardhi people of
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, for example, were marked as a "criminal
tribe" by a colonial British law in the early 1870s. While the law no longer stands
in India, the Phas&eacute; Pardhis face stigma and social ostracism to this day as a
result of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_Pardhi#Criminal_Branding" target="_blank">criminal-branding</a>.]</i></li>
  <li>Why do Adivasis live in jungle and not in human society? [Editor's note: This
question stems from another stereotype that all Adivasis live deep inside the
forests, cut off from all "human civilisation", and they necessarily do so out of
choice. Their choice indicates that they are uncultured and wild, or as the term
goes, "<a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jungli" target="_blank">jungli</a>"<sup>5</sup>. The fact is that very few indigenous populations have remained 5
completely untouched by outside influence, some of which has been very
damaging to them<sup>67</sup> and to the natural resources they have been tending to for 67
generations<sup>8</sup>.]</li>
  <li><i>What clothes do Adivasi wear?</i> The question by itself may be an innocuous
request for information. However, such questions tend to draw answers that
further reinforce negative stereotypes about indigenous people.<sup>9</sup> The right to
self-identification is considered a basic human right. Labeling anyone by their
physical appearance or traditional attire robs them of human dignity.</li>
</ul>
<i>
<p>[<strong>Editor's note:</strong> Quora is not considered a "reliable source" [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" target="_blank">WP:RS</a>] on English
Wikipedia, except in a few, limited and defined contexts<sup>10</sup> . However, the discussion about 
content on Quora is relevant for some reasons. Like Wikipedia, Quora is a free,
crowdsourced and collaborative source of information. Like Wikipedia, Quora has a
gender gap. Wikipedia has been among the five most visited websites in the world for
more than a decade; Quora gets a few hundred million visits every month<sup>11</sup> . India is the
second-largest user base of Quora in English<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite Quora's content moderation policies, the examples cited above are unlikely to be
removed or rectified. In some cases, the community standards and content policies do not
recognise the posts listed above as problematic. In some others, the moderators
themselves belong to far-removed demographics, as a result of which they may not
recognise the issues with such posts, even when the posts are reported. These are
well-documented issues with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content" target="_blank">user-generated content (UGC)</a> on the Internet.</p>
<p>Wikipedia articles are arguably the most viewed UGC online, at times causing
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_citogenesis_incidents" target="_blank">citogenesis</a>"<sup>13</sup> when incorrect information travels too far for too long. Observing the
examples above helps us understand how popular/ dominant discourse about
marginalized peoples attains visibility, discoverability and acceptability on popular
avenues and thus perpetuates itself online, while minority/ marginalised voices do not
have access to such "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect" target="_blank">network effects</a>" to put forth their side of the story.]</p>
</i>
<p>Serious attempts to silence the "underclass" on online platforms via harassment, bullying,
trolling and abuse, are reflective of oppressive social relations in the society today. The
online spaces are not safe, especially for women who are openly threatened and abused
on an everyday basis. The members of marginalized communities are either forced into
self-exclusion owing to the fear of online threats and abuse or they are adversely
incorporated into discourses that misrepresent them.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of words used in stigmatized representations of
marginalized groups in India</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Primitive</li>
  <li>Barbarians</li>
  <li>Backward</li>
  <li>Uncivilized</li>
  <li>Untouchables</li>
  <li>Low caste</li>
  <li>Savages</li>
  <li>Rent-seekers</li>
  <li>Impure</li>
  <li>Broken people</li>
  <li>Fourth world</li>
  <li>Backward Hindus</li>
  <li>Slaves</li>
  <li>Tribals</li>
  <li><i>Harijans</i></li>
</ul>
<p>On 24 March, 2017, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the term "<i>Harijan</i>" is clearly a
word of casteist insult and is abusive to the Dalit community.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>The terms "primitive" and "tribal" are often equated to the terms "savage" or
"uncivilized" in western imperialist literature and are used for demeaning other cultures.
Even though, a majority of the countries have officially replaced the terminology of
"tribe" to define <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autochthonous" target="_blank">autochthonous</a> people, India continues to use this derogatory term for
identifying the original inhabitants.<sup>15</sup> <i>[<strong>Editor's note:</strong> Unfortunately, the Indian 
government uses the word "tribal" and its variations for all official purposes. There is a
Ministry of Tribal Affairs (https://tribal.nic.in) and several Tribal Research Institutes<sup>16</sup> in 
the country.]</i></p>

<p><strong>Case study: Representation of Bonda women on Wikipedia</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonda_people" target="_blank">Bonda</a><sup>17</sup> is an Adivasi community living in Odisha. They are known for their distinctive 
cultural practices. The beautiful images of Bonda women are very popular on the Internet
because of their customary practice of keeping their heads shaved and decorating it with
colorful beads. However, the Wikipedia article on the Bonda people links these cultural
practices to the Bonda women being cursed in an incident from Hindu mythology. The
article states, <i>"The Bonda attire is explained in a legend relating to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana" target="_blank">Ramayana</a>.
According to it, some Bonda women chanced upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita" target="_blank">Sita</a> who was bathing at a pond in the
Bonda hills and, seeing her naked, they sniggered. Enraged, Sita cursed them to a life
where they would be condemned to remaining naked and having their heads shaven.
When the Bonda women pleaded forgiveness, Sita gave them a piece of cloth she tore off
her sari. This explains, according to the legend, why Bonda women have shorn heads and
wear only a ringa, a length of cloth that covers the waist."</i> There is no mention of such
an incident with reference to the Bonda people in the Hindu scriptures. Hence, such
statements published on the default encyclopedia of the Internet, which creates what is
considered "common knowledge", put immense stigma on the Bonda people and have a
dehumanising effect on them. <i>[<strong>Editor's note:</strong> The incident from the Ramayana is not
supported by any citations in the Wikipedia article as of 20 February 2019, 21:43 IST.]</i></p>
