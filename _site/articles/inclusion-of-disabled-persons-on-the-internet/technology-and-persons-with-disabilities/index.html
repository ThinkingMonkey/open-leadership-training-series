  <h2>
    Technology and persons with disabilities
  </h2>
</div>

<p>Technology has been the real game changer in removing the barriers to
participation of persons with disabilities. The visually impaired can now have
easy access to e-books and navigate most of the Internet with the help of screen
readers. The deaf and hard of hearing can enjoy closed captioning and sign
language interpretation for video material. Many persons with disabilities who
were thought to be "nonverbal" are making their voices heard through modified
keyboards. People who face immense barriers in even leaving their homes, be it
on account of psychosocial impairments or fatigue, have built thriving
communities and peer support with the power of their mobile phones.
Technology has also enabled people without disabilities to learn from the lived
experiences of people with disabilities, and perhaps help build a sense of
empathy towards their specific needs with regard to inclusion. A contributor to
Wikipedia may have a lot to draw from the lived experiences of persons with
disabilities, especially in terms of understanding impairments and other
disabling health conditions.</p>
<h3>Universal design</h3>
<p>In general, while designing systems or services adhering to the principle of
'universal design' is the best option to include the needs of all people, not just
persons with disabilities<sup>16</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> "What is Universal Design?" <a href="https://youtu.be/40FrlC2Bn6c17" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/40FrlC2Bn6c17</a></p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of universal design is the use of <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/" target="_blank">'plain
language'</a>. There are many benefits to plain language usage, including the fact
that it works better when machine translated into other languages. The layout of
documents written in simple language is overall more user friendly and helps
readers find specific information quickly. Writing Wikipedia entries in plain
language -- <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/media/FederalPLGuidelines.pdf" target="_blank">these guidelines are an example</a><sup>18</sup> -- would be an example of universal
design. The present practice of a separate 'Simple English Wikipedia' is not, as it
is specifically meant for a separate audience.</p>
<i><p>[<strong>Editor's note:</strong> English Wikipedia Manual of Style forbids "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Editorializing" target="_blank">editorialising</a>"<sup>19</sup> and the
use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Expressions_that_lack_precision" target="_blank">euphemisms</a><sup>20</sup> . It encourages the use of plain language instead of phrasing
that specially caters to the sensibilities of one or more sections of the readership.
For example, it is acceptable to write that the subject of a biographical article
"died" instead of "passed away". Referring to someone as "blind" or "disabled" is
also acceptable<sup>21</sup>.</p>
<p>The core policy for civility [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility" target="_blank">WP:Civil</a>], which forbids the use of profanity, vulgar
language, et cetera, prevails over most of the other rules, policies and guidelines on
Wikipedia and its sister projects. However, there are major disagreements between
Wikipedia contributors who do not want political correctness to take over the
representation of encyclopedic knowledge and those who want language to be
acceptable to certain sensibilities. These differences are resolved by acknowledging
in the article that certain terms may be considered offensive or pejoratives in
certain contexts, geographies, languages, et cetera. For example, the article entitled
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic" target="_blank">Spastic</a>" states, "Colloquially, spastic can be pejorative; though severity of this
differs between the United States and the United Kingdom. Disabled people in the
United Kingdom consider "spastic" to be one of the most offensive terms related to
disability." In some other cases, contributors arrive upon words acceptable to all
sides.]</p>
</i>
<p>Other good practices to make content universally designed include:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Captioning photos with clear descriptions:</strong> There may be options for
'alt-text'. This benefits users who use screen readers and also those with
slow or patchy Internet connections that do not load pictures. If this is not
an option, a brief description of the photograph in accompanying text will
also be readable by a screen reader. (Refer to Jennifer Stuton's <a href="https://www.sabeusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/A-Guide-to-Making-Documents-Accessible-to-People-Who-are-Blind-or-Visually-Impaired.pdf" target="_blank">"A Guide to
Making Documents Accessible to People Who Are Blind or Visually
Impaired"</a><sup>22</sup> and <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" target="_blank">https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Closed captioning of video content:</strong> YouTube supports automated
subtitles for videos in English but it is not very accurate. If you have made
a video based on a script or speech or lecture, you can upload the subtitle
file of the video to YouTube and YouTube will synchronise it for you. For
detailed instructions about how to add and edit captions to a YouTube
video, refer to:
<a herf="https://mediaaccess.org.au/web/how-to-caption-a-youtube-video" target="_blank">https://mediaaccess.org.au/web/how-to-caption-a-youtube-video</a></li>
  <li><strong>Audio description of videos:</strong> Audio description is like a voiceover meant
to narrate what is happening on screen to viewers who cannot see it.
Audio description is important where the visuals have some narrative
value. Refer to '<a href="https://youdescribe.org/" target="_blank">You Describe</a>'<sup>23</sup> for instructions about how to add audio
description to any YouTube video.</li>
  <li><strong>Transcripts of podcasts:</strong> While transcription helps the hearing impaired,
it is also of use to people who are not able to listen to the podcast for
other reasons. There are several options for transcribing audio to text
which can be made available online. <a href="https://www.happyscribe.co/" target="_blank">Happy Scribe</a><sup>24</sup> is one such
application. Note that it is a paid service.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign language interpretation:</strong> This is very helpful for the Deaf
community. Sign language is not a translation of spoken language. Sign
language is not the same across the entire world. If you want to provide
sign language interpretation for your video, ensure that you use an
interpreter who is conversant with the sign language used by your target 
audience. Provide the material for interpretation in advance to the
interpreter. Offer to help if the interpreters need better understanding of
any concept, as this will impact the quality of interpretation. Get feedback
from a Deaf individual on their understanding of the video before posting
it. It is recommended to provide both captions and sign language
interpretation wherever possible. Refer to the W3G guidelines for
"<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G54.html" target="_blank">Including a sign language interpreter in the video stream</a>"<sup>25</sup>.</li>
  <li><strong>Infographics:</strong> Infographics are all the rage but not all of them are
accessible. If an infographic is interactive, ensure you have an explainer
on how to use it. Some more tips on how to make infographics accessible
to all are available at <a href="https://piktochart.com/inclusive-design-make-visuals-accessible" target="_blank">Piktochart</a><sup>26</sup> . Additionally, you may refer to the W3G
working draft on accessibility needs for people with low vision<sup>27</sup> . While a
simple solution is to type out whatever the infographic says, you can also
try an audio clip of someone explaining the infographic, which may be
more appealing to readers having difficulty accessing the visualisation.</li>
